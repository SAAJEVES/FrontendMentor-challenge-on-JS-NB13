## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

From this project, JS was not too necessary in all the functionality as per this project because CSS would be able to solve much of the problem.

### Continued development

Still need more projects to help me organize my thinking in writing functionable javascript code

### Useful resources

A lot of resources was helpful not just in this project but from the beginning of my learning of web development.
